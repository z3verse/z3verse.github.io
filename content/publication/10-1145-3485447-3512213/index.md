abstract: 'Recent years have seen increased attacks targeting embedded web applications
  of IoT devices. An important target of such attacks is the hidden interface of embedded
  web applications, which employs no protection but exposes security-critical actions
  and sensitive information to illegitimate users. With the severity and the pervasiveness
  of this issue, it is crucial to identify the vulnerable hidden interfaces, shed
  light on best practices and raise public awareness. In this paper, we present, a
  new approach that automatically exposes hidden web interfaces of IoT devices. Specifically,
  constructs probing requests through firmware analysis to test physical devices,
  and narrows down the scope of identification by filtering out irrelevant requests
  and interfaces through differential analysis. It pinpoints hidden interfaces by
  attaching various device-setting parameters in the probing requests and matching
  keywords of sensitive information. Evaluated on 17 IoT devices, successfully identified
  44 vulnerabilities, including 43 previously unknown ones. also demonstrates surprising
  efficiency: on average, it delivered 151438 probing requests, taking only 47 minutes
  on each target device.'
