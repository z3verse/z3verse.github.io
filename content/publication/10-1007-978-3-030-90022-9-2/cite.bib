 abstract = {XXE vulnerability is a severe cybersecurity threat. OWASP listed the 10 most serious web application security risks, and XXE ranked fourth. This vulnerability can lead to sensitive information leakage, DoS attacks, and intranet asset discovery. Little attention has been given to this problem, and manual work is still needed to detect these vulnerabilities. Here, we design a penetration test framework, XHunter, to discover and exploit XXE vulnerabilities automatically. XHunter can find the call chain that triggers a vulnerability and determine the vulnerability's influence scope. Specifically, our work addresses many challenges in the analysis of modern web applications, such as object-oriented structures. In addition to detecting vulnerable sinks, we find the exploit path automatically. We give each vulnerability a risk rating based on the potential impact of the exploits. In this paper, we analyze 22 real-world web frameworks and find 8 unreported vulnerabilities, 2 of which have obtained CVE IDs.},
